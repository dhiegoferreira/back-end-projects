# Caching Proxy 


> What is a Caching Proxy 

- A caching proxy is a middleman between a client (e.g., web browser) and a server (e.g., an API or a website). It serves two main purposes:

1. Forwarindg Requests: When a client requests data, the proxy forwards the request to the actual server.
2. Caching Responses: If the server responds with data, the proxy stores (or chaches) that response. If the same request comes in again, the proxy serves the cached data instead of contacin the server again.
